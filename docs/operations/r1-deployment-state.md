# r1-01 (FSN1) deployment state

Snapshot of what's running on `136.243.90.96` as of 2026-04-23. Updated
at each session.

## Hardware

- Intel Core Ultra 7 265 (20 cores — 8 P + 12 E)
- 192 GB DDR5 ECC (4 × 48 GB single-bit-ECC verified)
- 4 × 7.68 TB Samsung PM9A3 NVMe (datacenter-grade, 1 DWPD / 14 PBW)
- Hetzner dedicated, FSN1 datacenter (Falkenstein, Germany)
- Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS noble

## Disk layout

```
nvme0n1 / nvme1n1 : OS mirror (mdadm RAID1)
                     p1  /boot/efi  512M  (per-drive vfat, not RAID)
                     p2  swap       4G    (md0, raid1)
                     p3  /          50G   (md1, raid1)
                     p4  ~7.63T     (ZFS raidz2 vdev)
nvme2n1 / nvme3n1 : untouched, full 7.68T (ZFS raidz2 vdevs)
```

ZFS pool `data` (raidz2, ~13.3 TB usable) with 7 datasets:
- `data/os` → `/var/lib/ratesengine`
- `data/postgres` → `/var/lib/postgresql` (recordsize=8K, logbias=throughput)
- `data/core` → `/var/lib/stellar-core`
- `data/rpc` → `/var/lib/stellar-rpc` (recordsize=16K)
- `data/galexie` → `/var/lib/galexie`
- `data/minio` → `/var/lib/minio`
- `data/archive` → `/srv/history-archive`

## Services (systemd)

## Stellar quorum set (trust anchors)

21 tier-1 validators across 7 orgs, identical to SDF's canonical
`packages/docs/examples/pubnet-validator-full/stellar-core.cfg`

## What's running in background

- **`stellar-archivist mirror`** in tmux session `archive-mirror`:
  pulling SDF's core_live_001 into `/srv/history-archive/`.
  Started 2026-04-23 13:26, ~467 MB after 5 min (→ ~1 TB in 3-4 h).
  Logs at `/var/log/stellar-archivist-mirror.log`.
  Check progress: `ssh root@… "tmux attach -t archive-mirror"` then
  Ctrl+B D to detach.

- **Healthchecks.io push every 5 min** reports service health +
  ledger-age + ZFS health + disk space. Currently pings `/fail` if
  stellar-rpc isn't yet `active` (expected on fresh start).

## Known gaps / next-session priorities

### Blocking
1. **Galexie not actually exporting yet.** captive-core is downloading
   catchup data but MinIO `galexie-live` still has only a
   `.config.json` (155 B). Either captive-core catchup is taking a
   long time (possible; full pubnet state is ~30 GB) or there's
   another issue downstream. Next session: check galexie's
   captive-core storage-path size growth + journalctl for
   first `Uploaded ledger …` line.

2. **SCVal decoders are stubs.** Nothing in our Go code actually
   decodes events yet. Even once stellar-rpc's DB is populated,
   `internal/sources/{soroswap,aquarius,phoenix,reflector}/decode.go`
   all return placeholder errors. This is the single biggest
   unblocker between "stack running" and "trade data flowing."

### Important but not urgent
3. **Firewall + SSH hardening (phase 3)** not applied. Intentional —
   avoiding lockout risk until the box is stable. Keep KVM tab
   ready when we do.

4. **Layer-2 monitoring (Prometheus on a separate box)** is still
   TODO. Layer-1 (Healthchecks.io push) catches total-death but
   not per-metric alerts — we have 27 runbooks wired to alert
   rules nobody is evaluating yet.

5. **pgBackRest** not configured. Postgres has no backups.

6. **stellar-archivist mirror → MinIO sync.** Our mirror lands on
   ZFS (`/srv/history-archive/`), not in MinIO. Phase-1 plan
   called for `aws s3 sync` post-mirror into `galexie-archive`
   bucket for durability. TODO after mirror completes.

### Backlog (no urgency)
7. Scope Galexie to a dedicated MinIO user with bucket-scoped
   write-only policy (task #156). Right now it uses root creds.

8. Galexie's resume-from-last-ledger behaviour: wrapper currently
   restarts from `archive_tip - 128` every time. Long-term should
   probe MinIO for last-exported-ledger and resume past it.

9. stellar-rpc full-history replay (multi-day). Only valuable once
   decoders work — otherwise nothing consumes the indexed events.

## Configuration pitfalls captured during first deploy

These are all now fixed in the role, but noted so the lessons survive:

1. Captive-core runs WITH a separate primary stellar-core on one box
   → every captive-core child MUST set `HTTP_PORT=0`, `PEER_PORT=0`,
   and the parent must pass matching values (stellar-rpc:
   `STELLAR_CAPTIVE_CORE_HTTP_PORT=0`).

2. Galexie's config schema is `[datastore_config]` / `[stellar_core_config]`
   — not what older docs suggest. Match `config/config.example.toml`
   from the galexie source tree at the pinned tag.

3. stellar-core's config parser has no "return to root" — anything
   after `[SECTION]` is scoped to that section. Top-level directives
   (KNOWN_PEERS, NETWORK_PASSPHRASE, DATABASE, etc.) must come
   BEFORE any `[...]` or `[[...]]` block.

4. `apt-stellar-rpc`'s shipped `/etc/default/stellar-rpc` hard-codes
   futurenet. systemd's `EnvironmentFile` takes precedence over
   `--config-path`. Either blank the file, or drop `EnvironmentFile`
   from the unit. Our role does the latter.

5. Galexie's append subcommand requires an explicit `--start`
   ledger; there's no auto-discover. Wrapper must query an archive's
   `.well-known/stellar-history.json` (NOT stellar-core's live
   tip — archives lag 5-15 min) and subtract a safety margin.

6. The stellar-galexie tag format is `galexie-vX.Y.Z`, and there are
   no prebuilt binaries. Build from source via
   `go install github.com/stellar/stellar-galexie@galexie-vX.Y.Z`
   and copy (NOT symlink) out of `/root/go/bin/` into `/usr/local/bin/`
   because `/root` is mode 0700.

## Credentials (pointers, not values)

- Vault password: in ash's password manager
- MinIO root: in `inventory/r1.secrets.yml` (vaulted)
- Postgres stellar-core role password: same
- Healthchecks.io ping URL: in `/etc/default/node-healthcheck` on
  the box (mode 0600), also to be added to `r1.secrets.yml` via
  `ansible-vault edit`
- SSH admin key: ed25519 public key in `inventory/r1.yml`
