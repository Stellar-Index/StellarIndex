# SEP-1 stellar.toml resolution — operational reference

Companion to [`docs/discovery/data-sources/sep1-home-domain.md`](../discovery/data-sources/sep1-home-domain.md)
(the design-time audit). This doc covers the **runtime** + **on-call**
concerns that don't fit a design audit:

- HTTP failure-mode handling per home-domain
- Cache invalidation policy
- SSRF guard playbook
- Operator-facing instructions

The implementation lives in `internal/metadata/`; see that
package's [`doc.go`](../../internal/metadata/doc.go) for the
in-code overview.

## Resolution flow

```
asset request →
  v1/assets/{id} handler →
    metadata.Cache.Get(home_domain)
      ↓ Redis HIT (15-min TTL)
        return cached SEP1 struct
      ↓ Redis MISS
        singleflight gate (one fetch per home_domain at a time)
        metadata.Resolver.Resolve(home_domain)
          ↓ HTTP GET https://<home_domain>/.well-known/stellar.toml
              ↓ DNS resolve → SSRF guard (private/loopback/link-local rejected)
              ↓ TLS handshake (5s timeout)
              ↓ HTTP read (10s total budget)
              ↓ TOML parse
          ↓ on success: write to Redis with 15-min TTL, return SEP1
          ↓ on failure: return error to caller; DO NOT cache the error
```

Every parameter — TTL, timeouts, SSRF allow-list — is documented
in `cachekeys.TOMLTTL` / `metadata.ResolverConfig` and bound by the
ADR-0007 Redis cache schema (`toml:<domain>` namespace).

## Failure modes

### 404 from upstream

The home-domain server returns 404 for `/.well-known/stellar.toml`.
Common causes:

- Issuer hasn't published a SEP-1 file (most cases — many small
  issuers don't bother).
- Issuer rotated the file path (very rare; SEP-1 mandates the
  `.well-known` location).

**Resolver behaviour:** returns `ErrSEP1NotFound`. **Cache
behaviour:** the error is NOT cached (per design — a transient
404 during a deployment shouldn't poison the cache for 15 min).
**Handler behaviour:** asset overlay degrades cleanly — fields
that come from SEP-1 are reported as `null`, the `home_domain`
field on the asset response stays populated from the `AccountEntry`,
the `sep1_status` field is set to `"not_found"`.

**On-call action:** none if a single asset is affected; investigate
if many home-domains report `not_found` simultaneously (suggests a
network egress problem on our side, not the issuers').

### TLS / connection error

Common causes:

- Issuer's TLS cert expired
- Hosting provider DNS down
- HTTPS-redirect loop
- Cert issued for a different name (CN mismatch)

**Resolver behaviour:** returns `ErrSEP1HTTP` wrapping the network
error. **Handler behaviour:** same as 404 — overlay degrades,
`sep1_status` becomes `"unreachable"`.

**On-call action:** scoped to that asset. The `host-down` and
`scrape-failing` runbooks don't apply here — this is third-party
infrastructure.

### Timeout

`metadata.ResolverConfig.HTTPTimeout` (default 10s) is the total
read budget. Slow issuers can blow this; we don't tune it per
host because that defeats the bound.

**Resolver behaviour:** `ErrSEP1Timeout`. **Cache:** not cached.
**Alert:** `ratesengine_metadata_resolver_timeout_total` increases
beyond baseline (P3 alert, designed but not yet shipping at v1).

### TOML parse error

The fetched bytes don't parse as valid TOML. Causes seen in the wild:

- Issuer's CMS injected HTML around the TOML
- BOM byte at the start (not always handled by the TOML parser)
- Trailing garbage
- Invalid UTF-8 sequences

**Resolver behaviour:** `ErrSEP1MalformedTOML`. **On-call action:**
report the issuer; we don't try to "fix" their published file.

### SSRF rejection

The `metadata.Resolver` resolves DNS first, then checks the
resolved IP against a private-range deny-list:

- IPv4 RFC 1918: 10/8, 172.16/12, 192.168/16
- IPv4 loopback: 127/8
- IPv4 link-local: 169.254/16 (catches AWS instance metadata
  service — `169.254.169.254`)
- IPv4 multicast: 224/4
- IPv6 RFC 4193 (private): fc00::/7
- IPv6 loopback: ::1
- IPv6 link-local: fe80::/10

**Resolver behaviour:** `ErrSEP1PrivateIP`. **On-call action:**
malicious-issuer event — investigate. The `home_domain` value on
the affected asset's account is operator-supplied but came from
the chain (issuer set it via `SetOptionsOp`); the offender is the
issuer, not us. Report to the security mailing list per
[security.md](../../SECURITY.md).

## Cache invalidation

The 15-min TTL handles routine staleness. Three cases need
explicit invalidation:

### 1. Issuer publishes a corrected stellar.toml

After a fix the issuer wants visible immediately. Invalidate the
single key:

```sh
redis-cli -h <redis-master> DEL "toml:<home_domain>"
```

The next request triggers a fresh fetch. Singleflight ensures
only one fetch even if many requests pile up at once.

### 2. Asset's `home_domain` changes on chain

Issuer sets a new `home_domain` via `SetOptionsOp`. The trades
hypertable + asset metadata table observe this in the
LedgerEntryChange stream. The OLD home-domain's cache entry is
still valid (it's the toml content that hasn't changed); the
asset's link to it is what flipped.

The asset-overlay handler reads the asset's CURRENT home_domain
and looks up the cache by that key. So a domain change is
self-resolving — no operator action needed unless the operator
specifically wants to evict the OLD domain's cache entry.

### 3. Bulk eviction (post-incident)

If a CDN or DNS provider issue caused many issuers to look broken
simultaneously, we may have cached degraded responses. Evict the
whole namespace:

```sh
redis-cli -h <redis-master> --scan --pattern "toml:*" | \
  xargs -n 100 redis-cli -h <redis-master> DEL
```

Sub-second on a few hundred entries. Won't melt Redis. Subsequent
asset requests trigger fresh fetches; singleflight gates the
thundering herd.

## Operator-facing tasks

### Adding a curated home-domain override

Some issuers don't publish stellar.toml; we want the asset detail
to still display useful metadata. The operator config has a
per-asset override map:

```yaml
# config/asset_metadata_overrides.yaml
overrides:
  "USDC:GA5ZSEJYB37JRC5AVCIA5MOP4RHTM335X2KGX3IHOJAPP5RE34K4KZVN":
    name: "USD Coin"
    desc: "USDC issued by Circle on Stellar"
    image: "https://example.cdn/usdc.png"
    max_supply: null  # uncapped
```

Override values stamp `sep1_status: "operator_override"` on the
asset response so consumers know the source.

### Removing a stale override

Same file; delete the entry. Server reloads on SIGHUP (no restart
needed) — the resolver picks up the new map within one request.

### Tracing a specific asset's resolution

`ratesengine-ops sep1-trace -domain <home_domain>` (Phase 5
deliverable; not yet implemented) would dump the full resolution
path: DNS, IP, SSRF check result, HTTP status, parsed fields.
For now the manual playbook is:

```sh
# 1. Confirm what the API sees
curl -sf https://api.ratesengine.net/v1/assets/<asset_id> | jq .

# 2. Confirm what the cache holds
redis-cli -h <redis-master> GET "toml:<home_domain>"

# 3. Bypass the cache, hit the issuer directly
curl -sfL "https://<home_domain>/.well-known/stellar.toml"

# 4. If 1 and 3 disagree but 2 looks stale, force-refresh:
redis-cli -h <redis-master> DEL "toml:<home_domain>"
```

## Metrics + alerts

The `internal/metadata` package emits these counters / gauges via
`internal/obs`:

- `ratesengine_metadata_resolver_requests_total{status}` —
  status ∈ {ok, not_found, http_error, timeout, parse_error,
  private_ip_blocked}.
- `ratesengine_metadata_cache_hits_total` /
  `ratesengine_metadata_cache_misses_total`.
- `ratesengine_metadata_resolver_duration_seconds` histogram.

Alert: `ratesengine_metadata_resolver_error_rate_high` (P3 in
[alerts-catalog.md](alerts-catalog.md) — "designed but not yet
shipping" pending Phase-5 wiring of the metadata overlay into
the asset handler).
