# CoinGecko / CoinMarketCap Parity Matrix

CG and CMC are the consumer benchmarks. This matrix enumerates
every feature one of them ships and records whether we ship the
equivalent. Closure rule: every row must be filled before the
audit closes (no blank `?` cells).

Scoring:

- `covered` — we ship it, with proof (file:line or live URL)
- `partial` — we ship some of it; specify the gap
- `gap` — we don't ship it; finding required
- `non-goal` — explicit product decision; cite the decision doc
- `n/a` — feature is structurally impossible for our scope

## Coin / Asset metadata

| Feature | CG | CMC | Us | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Asset detail page (description, links, contracts) | ✅ | ✅ | `/v1/assets/usdc` lives (EV-0033 — description, class, verified_issuer, networks[]) | `covered` | live curl EV-0033 |
| Verified-currency badge | ✅ | ✅ | `/v1/assets/verified` + per-asset `verified_issuer` field | `covered` | `internal/currency/verified.go` + EV-0033 |
| Social links | ✅ | ✅ | SEP-1 toml resolution surfaces `home_domain` + `documentation` URL | `covered` | `internal/metadata/sep1.go`; CG/CMC use API-stored fields, we use the issuer's own SEP-1 (more authoritative) |
| Whitepaper link | ✅ | ✅ | SEP-1 toml `org_description_url` / `documentation_url` | `covered` (CG/CMC-equivalent) | `internal/metadata/sep1.go` |
| Tags / categories | ✅ | ✅ | `asset_class` taxonomy (fiat/stablecoin/crypto/rwa) + class on `/v1/sources` (exchange/oracle/aggregator/lending/router/bridge/authority_sanity) | `covered+` (richer than CG's free-form tags) | EV-0045 |
| ATH / ATL | ✅ | ✅ | `/v1/assets/{slug}` extension fields | `covered?` | rc.43..rc.46 features — needs live re-verify under cascade |
| Circulating supply | ✅ | ✅ | `/v1/assets/native` returns `circulating_supply: 500018068120000000` | `covered` | live EV-0032 |
| Total supply | ✅ | ✅ | same response: `total_supply: 500018068120000000` | `covered` | EV-0032 |
| Max supply | ✅ | ✅ | same: `max_supply: 500018068120000000` | `covered` | EV-0032 |
| Market cap | ✅ | ✅ | `/v1/assets/native` returns `market_cap_usd: 7553783305.96` | `covered` | EV-0032 |
| Fully-diluted valuation | ✅ | ✅ | `/v1/assets/native` returns `fdv_usd: 7553783305.96` | `covered` | EV-0032 |
| Sparkline | ✅ | ✅ | `/v1/assets/native` returns `price_history_24h: [{t:...}]` array | `partial` | EV-0032; only 24h, CG also offers 7d/30d/90d/1y |
| Top markets / pairs | ✅ | ✅ | `/v1/markets?limit=50` 48/50 fresh markets (F-0063 nit accepted) | `covered` | EV-0030 |
| Tickers (per-exchange) | ✅ | ✅ | `/v1/markets` data includes `source` per row | `covered` | EV-0030 + EV-0043 |
| Image / logo | ✅ | ✅ | SEP-1 `image_url` overlay | `covered` | `assets_sep1.go` |
| Holder distribution | ✅ | ✅ | not implemented | `gap` | Stellar Expert + horizon's `/accounts?asset=...` could feed this; current scope is price not holder topology |
| Top holders | ✅ | ✅ | not implemented | `gap` | same as above |
| Per-account net position (SEP-41) | ❌ | ❌ | `GET /v1/contracts/{contract_id}/transfers?from=&to=` reads from `sep41_transfers` hypertable (F-0021 closure 2026-05-27) | `covered+` | **Stellar moat:** CG/CMC structurally cannot offer — their data ingest doesn't observe on-chain transfers. `internal/sources/sep41_transfers/` decoder + migration 0047 + sibling `sep41_supply` for mint/burn/clawback give complete audit-trail coverage. |
| Sentiment % up/down | ✅ | ✅ | not implemented | `non-goal` | community signal, not authoritative pricing surface |
| User ratings | ✅ | ✅ | not implemented | `non-goal` | community signal |

## Global / Network stats

| Feature | CG | CMC | Us | Status | Evidence |

## Audit pass output

Each `?` cell above must be resolved to one of `covered` /
`partial` / `gap` / `non-goal` / `n/a` before the matrix is
closed. `partial` and `gap` cells generate findings.

Where we ship `covered+` (deeper than CG/CMC), that's a launch
narrative win and should appear in the Stellar coverage matrix
([09-stellar-coverage-matrix.md](09-stellar-coverage-matrix.md))
as an explicit moat.
